# HackAI 2024 Website
Sadly, this was never launched. However, the Tech Tank website is mostly the exact same, and it is located in the tech-tank branch of this repo. Tech Tank was our pivot event that replaced HackAI in 2024. 

## Development
This project is built using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), a React framework
that allows static builds of the website.

This repository assumes you already have Node.js and NPM installed. If have not
installed those in your development environment, [install](https://nodejs.dev/)
before proceeding.

To import the necessary libraries, clone the repository and run:
```shell script
npm i --force
```

To start the local development server, run:
```shell script
npm run dev
```

To build the website into a bundle that can be deployed on any static hosting
provider, run:
```shell script
npm run build
```
